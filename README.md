Findings about the Code
Overview
The provided code includes two approaches to solve the problem of giving change using a set of coin denominations: a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm. These approaches are encapsulated in the functions find_coins_greedy and find_min_coins, respectively.

Greedy Algorithm (find_coins_greedy)
Approach:

Uses the highest denomination coins available first.
Continues using the highest denomination until the required amount is met.
Adjusts the amount and available coins dynamically.

Pros:
Fast and simple to implement.
Generally efficient for most practical purposes.

Cons:
Does not guarantee the minimum number of coins.
May not always provide the optimal solution, especially for certain combinations of denominations.

Dynamic Programming Algorithm (find_min_coins)
Approach:

Iterates through available coins, starting from the highest denomination.
Uses a systematic approach to ensure the minimum number of coins is used.
Adjusts the amount and tracks the number of each coin used.
Pros:

Guarantees the minimum number of coins.
Provides an optimal solution for any given amount.
Cons:

More complex implementation.
Potentially higher computational cost, especially for larger amounts.

Efficiency: Ensures optimality but can be slower for larger amounts due to the nested loop structure.

Practical Implications
For real-world applications such as a cash register, where speed and simplicity are crucial, the greedy algorithm is generally preferable.
For applications where the exact minimum number of coins is critical, the dynamic programming approach should be used despite its potential complexity and slower execution time.
